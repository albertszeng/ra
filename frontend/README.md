# Ra Frontend

## Getting Started

The front-end uses the `React` framework. 

- Install `npm` and `node` from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
- Run `npm install` from this directory to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to run the frontend locally.

Note that by default, hot-reloading is available. The entry-point for the application is `index.tsx` so start there.

## Deployment

This is triggered on github.
